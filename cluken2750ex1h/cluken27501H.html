<p>The Gear Pass is a new concept in the snowboarding world. In order to improve customer experience on the resorts, this pass will span across several resorts and be an add-on to the customer&#39;s season pass. The pass will allow the customers to try out different pieces of gear. This pass will have a multitude of options associated with it. The pass will have different tiers and levels for the customer to choose from. Depending on what &#39;Level&#39; the customer chooses they will get anywhere from a snowboard, snow boots, and helmet to a snowboard, snow boots, helmet, goggles, coat, and pants. The &#39;Tier&#39; that they choose will dictate the quality of the equipment they are using. Tier 1 would be the most recent season&#39;s gear, and it would go down to Tier 3 which would be older gear but a more affordable option. The Gear Pass will include information about each piece of gear that the customer can choose from. The Pass will also keep information about the customer, and the condition of the gear. </p>
